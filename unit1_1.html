            <h3>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>In the modern world, more and more businesses have come to depend on IT for a 
                variety of reasons. A large part of businesses swapping over to IT is that it is much faster, 
                effect and more cost effective for them to use. The main focus of a business is to make profit, 
                therefore by utilising IT systems, they can widen their profit margins further. For example, 
                imagine having a list of customers. Without IT systems, the list would most likely be filed on 
                paper. To locate one customer out of that database, you would have to physically search through 
                to find them, which takes time. With a digital database, you can just search through in a matter of 
                seconds to find the customer information.<br>
                <br>Not only do IT systems allow a business to be more efficient within itself, it also allows it 
                to become more global. Through the internet, a business is able to reach a much wider audience and 
                potential customer base. Not only can you contact people from around the world, you can also collaborate 
                and share resources and information too.

            <h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skill and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            <p>With such a wide range of resources available, there are many ways to complete digital projects 
                successfully. First of all, it is important to identify the best software and hardware needed to 
                make your project a success. So for example, in the context of this website, to create it I have 
                used HTML and CSS. The benefit of these are that they allows control over each part of the site, and 
                allow me to customise it to my standards and tastes. HTML and CSS are also great for if you want
                to expand on the site further, as it allows greater flexibility. Different digital projects 
                require different things, so it is important to first of all identify what you want to achieve.<br>
                <br>Further resources that will help you with your digital projects are communication tools to 
                allow a team to work together efficiently. These might be apps or sites like Slack, which allows 
                teams to communicate and share ideas, or GitHub, which allows teams to work on a single project 
                online together.

            <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website</h3>
            <p>For planning my website, I will be using Trello in order to break the task into smaller, 
                more manageable parts. This will help me to work more efficiently. It will help me to remember 
                smaller, but still important parts of building my website e.g. fonts, colours etc. The benefits 
                of Trello is that it is a free tool that allows you to display your tasks very visually. It is 
                also easy to use and flexible, to allow you to cater your use to your personal project and style 
                of planning.<br>
                See my Trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/tGfR2wGV/website" target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
                <br>Another app I will be using is Slack, in order to check back and discuss ideas or issues I come across.

            <h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
            <p>Some of the biggest risks that you can face with digital projects is, of course, hardware issues. 
                This might include the internet going down (meaning you cannot access any content you have online, 
                or contact members of your team), or it could be that your computer breaks. These risks can be 
                minimised by having regular and multiple back-ups both online and offline.<br>
                <br>Another risk of digital projects is that new technology is always being developed. This means 
                that what you are developing may suddenly need to be updated/changed to work on a newer system 
                (e.g. new Apple iOS). Although you cannot always plan for these kinds of issues, it is important 
                to be prepared or at least be prepared to adapt to the situation.

            <h3>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p>	For any business, selecting the right kinds of IT systems and software is important. There’s no 
                point in buying the newest and fanciest tech if it is not relevant to your business.<br>
                <br>First of all, you should define the problem and work out what exactly needs to be done. 
                You should think about the workflow and how it will be used day-to-day. Are you looking for something 
                that will allow staff to collaborate together online? Are you looking for something that can track 
                inventory? Decide which features you cannot live without.<br>
                <br>The next stage is to research various solutions. Think about whether you need just one solution 
                or if you may need multiple. Are there any other features not related to day-to-day use that you 
                absolutely need? At this point it is also important to compare a few different options to decide which 
                might work best. Getting feedback from your team can also help. If you’re all mostly agreed on what 
                is needed then you can be sure that that feature is important.<br>
                <br>Finally, weigh up the cost of the system. Do you really need a new software or system? Is it 
                efficient for the business to purchase it? Just because something is the newest does not necessarily 
                mean is the best for your business’ situation.

            <h3>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
            <p>	Using Trello helped to keep me organised by allowing me to break down the tasks into smaller, more 
                manageable tasks. It allowed me to work through the project efficiently, and to not forget any of the 
                smaller details. Because it is very visual, it helped me to see exactly what was left and what needed 
                doing and meant that I did not take on too many small tasks all at once, but ensured that I was finishing 
                off parts.<br>
                <br>Using GitHub allows me to keep my site code up to date no matter where I am working on it, as well 
                as keep it as a back-up in case of issues.

            <h3>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
            <p>The Companies Act 2006 requires businesses to disclose certain pieces of information on 
                their websites. It should be easy for people to find. These pieces of information are things such as 
                the company's name, their registered phone number, registered office address, email addresses,
                VAT numbers etc.<br>
            <br>In May 2018, GDPR regulations came into effect. This legislation covers how personal information 
            of customers or users is processed and accessed.<br>
            <br>Websites should be accessible to everyone who needs it, according to the Equality Act 2010. 
            This includes things such as being compatible with commonly used assistive technology (e.g. 
            screen magnifiers, speech recognition tools) and including people with disabilities in user research.<br>
            <br>All websites and their content are inherently copyright protected, as long as they are original 
            works. Businesses should be aware of copyright and avoid using material that belongs to someone else’s 
            copyrights (e.g. using someone else’s images without permission)
