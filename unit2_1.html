            <h3>1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
            <p>On all my pages, I have the menu bar at the top to help direct users to the different pages, and at the 
                bottom is the footer with a couple of links back to my about page and some contact, as well as copyright.
                <dl>
                    <dt>index.html</dt>
                    <dd>This is my welcome page. It serves as a starting point of my website. There’s an image and a brief 
                        intro to the website. This is the only page without a background image as it looked cleaner without 
                        the background image. I have added some links to the other pages in a more conversational way.</dd>
                    <dt>about.html</dt>
                    <dd>This is my About Me page. It has a brief introduction and image of myself. Further down the page 
                        is a longer description about me and why I want to do coding (assignment 1, 1.0). I have also 
                        included some smaller images as clickable links so you can click them and see the image bigger.</dd>
                    <dt>cats.html</dt>
                    <dd>This is a page dedicated to pictures of my cats. I have put the images smaller on the page, but 
                        still a viewable size. Each picture can be clicked to open the original sized .jpg in another tab 
                        if you want to see them bigger. There is three sections: one for Wookie, one for Henry, and one for 
                        pictures of them both.</dd>
                    <dt>Assignment pages</dt>
                    <dd>All my assignment pages are kept in a similar style and layout for consistency. At the top is links 
                        connected to anchors of each of the question answers, so you can navigate to questions without scrolling 
                        manually. There’s also a “return to top” link under each of the answers, so you can jump back to the top 
                        without needing to scroll back. The answers are all separated by a link break image (coffee cups) to break it 
                        up for readability.</dd>

            <p>Websites should be aware of copyright and avoid using images they do not have the rights to. For my website, I 
                used images that I either had permission to use (welcome page image, stock background) or that I own the copyright 
                to (photos I have taken myself).<br>
                <br>If it is a business-owned website, then there are certain laws that must be followed, such as the Companies 
                Act 2006. This legislation states that certain pieces of information needs to be disclosed.

            <h3>1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
            <p>There are a number of disabilities that affect people and can cause issues for them accessing websites. 
                A few of these are:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Blindness</dt>
                    <dd>People who are blind rely on screen reading technology in order to access websites. This software reads 
                        text on the screen out loud. Websites that don’t use much text or don’t put ‘alt’ text on their images can 
                        make it difficult for this technology to work correctly. Having clear text and ensuring images have clear 
                        alt text helps these to work.</dd>
                    <dt>Low Vision</dt>
                    <dd>People with low vision may prefer to use magnifying readers, extra-large monitors, or just increase 
                        the size of pages. If webpages have absolute sizing it can make it difficult for them to enlarge the 
                        elements. Websites with inconsistent layouts may also be confusing to navigate as surrounding context 
                        is often loss when a page is enlarged. By keeping a consistent and simple layout it can make it much 
                        easier for people with low vision to navigate.</dd>
                    <dt>Colourblindness</dt>
                    <dd>People with colourblindness may use their own screen filters to help them see site clearer. By ensuring 
                        the website is designed with good contrast and avoiding the most commonplace colourblindness 
                        combinations (red-green colourblindness, or yellow-blue colourblindness) it can help considerably.</dd>
                    <dt>Learning disabilities</dt>
                    <dd>While there are a wide range of learning disabilities, some of the most common issues that you come 
                        across is with dyslexia. People with dyslexia often use a colour filter on their screens or tinted 
                        glasses to help them to read easier. They also may use stylesheets to help them change the font something 
                        more readable (i.e. comic sans and papyrus fonts are much easier for dyslexic people to read than times 
                        new roman or any serif fonts). Ensuring that your website colours have good contrast and that a colour 
                        filter would not make text disappear into backgrounds is important to keep in mind. Keeping a consistent 
                        layout also helps to keep your website as simple and easy to navigate as possible.</dd>

            <h3>1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
            <p>For the pages written in HTML, .html is the file type used. It is also common for a .css file to be used to style 
                the website.<br>
                <br>Images should not have too large a file size. These can be in .jpg, .png or even animated .gifs. 
                There’s a wide range of supported image types, but commonly you will see .jpgs and .pngs.<br>
                <br>If a website uses sound, that is commonly a .mp3 file. Although some shorter samples may be in .wav files.<br>
                <br>Some websites also use video, which will usually be in a .mpeg or a .mov file if it is for streaming directly.
