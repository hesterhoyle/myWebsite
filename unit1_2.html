            <h3>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own 
                website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
            <p>I have used Visual Studio Code as my main application to write my website code on. I’m very happy with 
                using Visual Studio Code as it is very user-friendly. It’s easy to work with and update any changes 
                I’ve needed to make.<br>
                <br>I have also used Trello to help me with organising my project. It is very good because it’s so 
                visual that it allows me to see straight away what parts I’ve done, what parts I’m currently working on, 
                and what is left to do.

            <h3>2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
            <p>I feel that Visual Studio Code was the most appropriate for me to use, as it is easy to work with. 
                The program helps by giving suggestions (e.g. when typing in “padding” it suggests all options like 
                “padding-left”) which helps speed up the process and if I get stuck with certain codes, it’s easy to look 
                up. I have used Visual Studio Code during this course and it is the program I am most familiar with.<br>
                <br>Trello is very customisable and flexible to use, so I can add and move tasks around as needed. 
                I can use it easily and it doesn’t take much time to set up, which allows me to focus more on the content 
                of my project work.

            <h3>2.3 - Asses the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
            <p>Overall, I’m generally happy with my website. I think it’s easy for users to navigate. I also like using 
                colours with good contrast to make the content easier to read.<br>
                <br>Next time, I’d like to be a little bit more creative. However I feel that there’s a lot more code I 
                need to learn before I’m able to do this. I’d like to add more visuals to my site, and improve my welcome 
                screen to be more visually grabbing.

            <h3>2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
            <p>Time allowing, I would have liked to add more visuals and integrate them further. For example, put my cat 
                pictures as a slideshow, or add some videos. I’d have liked to rework the background a little more and 
                design one myself rather than using a stock image. I would also have liked to integrate a JavaScript game 
                into the site, however I’m limited with the code that I know and it would take time to research and learn 
                how to do all that.

            <h3>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
            <p>I placed a menu/navigation bar at the top of my site so it is easy to see in order for users to navigate 
                to the different pages easily. I’ve tested that the buttons all work as intended, that links are not broken 
                etc. I have aimed to keep colours of text and backgrounds high contrast (e.g. on my menu bar, it’s dark 
                background with white text). In some areas, I’ve added a white semi-transparent background to help readability. 
                With images, I’ve tried to keep them a reasonable size. Any images that are links go semi-transparent when 
                hovered over so that the user can see which image they are about to click on.
