    <p id="personalStatement">Like 89% of Code Nation’s students, I had no coding experience before joining the Develop course 
        at Cambridge’s Digital Academy. Since undertaking this course, I have discovered just how much I enjoy 
        coding. Although it is a newer interest to me, it’s something that has really clicked with me. 
        The feeling is hard to put into words, but imagine if you’ve always worn the wrong sized shoes and suddenly 
        one day, you put on a pair that fits you perfectly. Since starting with the Digital Academy, I feel like I 
        fit in and I can see a future for me in coding.<br>
        <br>I have always been interested in new technology, in particular video games. I previously volunteered 
        with a company called DDR:UK. They specialised in bringing a wide range of games, from console gaming to full 
        arcade cabinets, to events all around the country. Through these events, I became passionate about working with 
        gaming communities, which led me to streaming games online through sites like Twitch and Mixer.<br>
        <br>Despite my love of the industry, I never thought I could be a part of it as I always assumed coding and 
        programming were too difficult for me to learn. However, I previously studied another difficult language – 
        Japanese. This was at the University of Sheffield, where I spent two years before illness forced me to leave 
        the course. By thinking about coding as learning a new language, I am using similar learning techniques, 
        which is helping me to pick up better on the ‘vocabulary’ and syntax.<br>
        <br>Being a logical thinker has also helped me on the Develop course. Quite often after lessons, I’ll find 
        myself mulling over the various challenges and activities. At A Level I achieved a C in Maths, a B in 
        English Language, and an A in Business studies. I also achieved a B in Physics at AS Level. I love logic 
        puzzles and often play them on my phone in my spare time.<br>
        <br>However, coding is something that is not just logical, but also creative. I’ve always been quite artistic 
        with my hobbies. I love to create things and have even won awards for various costumes I made. As a child 
        I would make my own little games using software like RPG Maker to build my own worlds. Being able to combine 
        my creative side with my logical brain has really made me fall in love with coding.
