            <h3>3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <p>I feel that I worked fairly efficiently, especially considering the time constraints. I used Trello to keep 
                my tasks organised. Using Visual Studio Code was very efficient as it can help suggest what terms and code 
                you want as you start typing. It also can highlight same IDs and classes to help you see quickly where it is 
                in the code without needing to search.<br>
                <br>I could have been more efficient by making a full schedule of my time and breaks, however I feel that that 
                would be a little excessive for such a short project. If I had worked in a team, it would also have been 
                more efficient as I could have divided up the tasks between us.

            <h3>3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <p>Good ways to improve productivity are things such as using planning apps like Trello to break up tasks into 
                smaller, more manageable bites. It is also important to take breaks so that you can come back to a task with 
                a fresh look. It’s important not to try doing too many tasks at once. If working in a team, you should try 
                to communicate efficiently (e.g. through regular meetings, or apps like Slack). A good way to manage things 
                is to group similar tasks together, such as focussing on content first and styling second.

            <h3>3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
            <p>In the future, I would dedicate some time to a proper planning stage. During this stage I would start to 
                flesh out overall design of the site on paper or something similar. This way, I wouldn’t need to chop and 
                change parts as much to work out how to make things fit nicely.<br>
                <br>If I was able to work in a team, I’d use the team to delegate tasks to. We would have to ensure we could 
                communicate well, e.g. using Slack and having regular catch ups.<br>
                <br>Depending on the length of the project, I might also draw up a schedule of my day and weeks to work out 
                how long I want to dedicate to each part of the project.

            <h3>3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
            <p>First of all I would check that my links and buttons all worked by trying them out. I’d view each page in a 
                browser to ensure it looks how I want it to look. I would also test it on several browsers (i.e. mobile, 
                chrome, safari etc.) to ensure that it still works and looks right.<br>
                <br>I would also ask a second person to check that links and buttons work, and that they feel the site is 
                readable etc.
